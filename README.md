Iacta Alea Est
==============

`iae` is a simple dice parser. Is goal is to be a (nearly) drop-in replacement for [DiceParser](https://github.com/Rolisteam/DiceParser). The main difference is that some operators were redondants and have been cleaned.

It name come from *iacta alea est* (the die is cast). It is really short, witch is conviniant to roll a lot of dices in a row!
